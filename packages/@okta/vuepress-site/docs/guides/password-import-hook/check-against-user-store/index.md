title: Check credentials against user store
---

For purposes of demonstration, we'll look up the username value in a prepopulated static array of usernames and passwords, checking if the password supplied matches the password that exists for that username in the array.

This is meant as a simplified stand-in for the process of looking up the credentials in your user store, whatever that process might be for the particular user store system that you have.
