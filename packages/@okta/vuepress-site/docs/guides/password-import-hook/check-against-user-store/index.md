title: Check credentials against user store
---

For purposes of demonstration, we'll look up the user name in a prepopulated static array of user names and passwords, checking if the password supplied matches the password that exists for that user name in the array.

This is meant as a simplified stand-in for the process of looking up the credentials in your user store, whatever that process might be for the particular user store that you have.
