# Document Archive

The document archive stores articles on technologies and techniques that are no longer supported by Okta. The articles themselves are also no longer maintained or updated.

## PHP

In 2023, Okta sunsetted support for its PHP SDKs and it was decided to archive the PHP-related material in February 2024.
